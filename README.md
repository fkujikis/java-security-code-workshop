# Java Security Code Workshop
In this step by step workshop, you'll learn how to exploit this Java application and the code changes you need to make to fix it.

## Required software
- Java 8
- Maven
- Browser (preferably Chrome)
- IDE / Code editor + Lombok plugin

# Introduction

This workshop contains a demo Java application build on with Spring boot and Thymeleaf.
It contains a number of security issues in the source code.
During this workshop, you will locate, exploit and fix the vulnerabilities in this application.

The vulnerabilities covered in this workshop:
- XML External entity injection (XXE)
- SQL injection
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Encryption
- 

## Installation

- Check out the repository
- go to the `java-code-workshop` folder
- Run `mvn clean package`
- Run `mvn spring-boot:run`

Alternatively, you can run this Spring boot app from your IDE if you wish to do that.

## Application
When your application is running you can access it at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

This application allows you to search through a user database and allows you to do some basic admin tasks on that.
Play around for a bit to see how it works.


# Assignments

## Assignment 1 Search

On the Search page, you can search the users by **username**.
By using a `%` you can provide wildcards. For instance `Super%` will give you the result for **Superman**
Using the search term `%man`

### 1a Try to create a search phrase that searches for the **firstname** 'Bruce'

### 1b Try to override every **lastname** with 'EVIL'

## Assignment 2 Import

On the import page, you can import new users by using an XML.
We already created a sample XML file `users.xml` that you can use to import new users

### 2a import new users using the `user.xml` file.
### 2b edit the file so we can read the `etc/passwd` file on your machine (or any other file for that matter)

## Assignment 3 Add User

On the *Add User* page you can manually add new Users
This is quite straight forward.

![AddUser](images/adduser.png)

### 3a Try to insert a new user using the form.
### 3b Try to do a code insertion when creating a new user.

### 3c Try to display the token of a user that is on the page

Click to see [Hint 3](hints/adduser/hint3.md)

Click to see [Hint 4](hints/adduser/hint4.md)

We just proved that we can execute code in the userâ€™s browser.     
We also showed that we can simple access and display the cookie. Imagine that we send this token in the cookie to another website and take over your session?

### 3d Fix this by sanitizing the input before it enters the database

## Assignment 4 passwords

The password of the users are stored in plain text. This is not recommended as the passwords are readable by default.
For storing password it is recommended to use a strong cryptographic hashing function.

In short: a hashing function is a one-way 'encryption' function that transforms a String into a fixed-sized sequence of characters (the hash).
The function is irreversible so you cannot use the function to recover the original Sting.
A cryptographic hashing function is a hashing function that is suitable for cryptographic purposes. More info ...

### 4a Create a function `encodePassword(String)` in `PasswordUtil` that uses BCrypt to encode passwords.

Click to see [Hint 2](hints/password/hint2.md)

Click to see [Hint 3](hints/password/hint3.md)

### 4b Make sure that the password for a `User` is not stored in plain text. Instead, store the BCrypt hash

Click to see [Hint 5](hints/password/hint5.md)

### 4c Fix text password

You can test the password of a user by clicking the blue "Test password ..." button in the Search page.
A new page will open where you can enter the original password. Make sure that this functionality works again.
